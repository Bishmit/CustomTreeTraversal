# Custom Graph/Tree Traversal Simulator

# Description
This is a dynamic graph traversal simulator built using SFML. It allows you to create graphs interactively and visualize DFS or BFS traversal dynamically.

# Controls
- Press `C` to add a new circle (node).
- Left Click (Mouse) to drag a circle and move it around.
- Press `S` to snap two circles together, creating an edge between them.
- Press Left Shift + Left Click (Mouse) to traverse to the clicked node.
- ctrl and mouse movent to whole select
- middle mouse button to drag and drop after doing whole select
- scroll up and down for zoom in and zoom out (panning)

# Features
- Interactive Graph Creation: Add nodes, drag them, and connect them to form a graph.
- Real-Time Traversal Visualization: Choose DFS or BFS and see the traversal dynamically.
